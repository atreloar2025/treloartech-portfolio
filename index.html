      <h2>About Me</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
      <p>I am a second-year master's of communication student at New Mexico State University. I spent the end of my undergrad here while playing baseball for the school. I now get to coach baseball at the school as our director of pitching analytics. Baseball has always been a passion of mine. It has been wonderful to be able to share my knowledge of the game, to up and coming collegiate baseball players. </p>
